{"question":"1. How does the optical activity depend on the state of the substance?",
"answers":{
            "a":"If the compound is present in (+) form, it rotates plane polarized light in anticlockwise direction and if it is present in (-) form, it rotates plane polarized light in clockwise direction with equal magnitude.",
            "b":"If the compound is present in (+) form it rotates plane polarized light in clockwise direction and if it is present in (-) form, it rotates plane polarized light in anticlockwise direction with different magnitude.",
            "c":"If the compound is present in (+) form it rotates plane polarized light in clockwise direction and if it is present in (-) form, it rotates plane polarized light in anticlockwise direction with same magnitude.",
            "d":"Both rotates the plane polarized light in same direction with equal magnitude."
          },
"correctAnswer":"c"},

{"question":"2. Given that (R)-2-bromobutane has a specific rotation of -23.1o ,what is the specific rotation of (S)-2-bromobutane?",

{"question":"3. Which isomer is dominant in a mixture of (R)- and (S)-2-bromobutane whose specific rotation was found to be -9.2<sup>o</sup> ?",
"answers":{
            "a":"Both R and S enantiomers are found in equal proportions.",
            "b":"The negative sign indicates that the R enantiomer is the dominant one",
            "c":"The negative sign indicates that the S enantiomer is the dominant one.",
