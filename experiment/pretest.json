{"question":"1. How does polarized light differ from the ordinary light? ",
"answers":{
            "a":"Polarized light have vibrations in single plane where as ordinary light have vibrations in more than one plane .",
            "b":"Polarized light have vibrations in more than one plane where as ordinary light have vibrations in single plane",
            "c":"Polarized light and ordinary light wave have opposite vibrations in the space .",
            "d":"Polarized light have vibrations at 90o to the ordinary light wave vibrations."
