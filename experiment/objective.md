 The purpose of this lab is to use optical rotation as a method for determining the identity of unknown sugars. By doing this experiment the user will be able to:

   1. Understand the interaction of plane polarized light with solutions of chiral substances
   2. Understand various processes and techniques involved in measuring the optical activity of sugar solutions using polarimeter.
   3. Understand the step-by-step procedure including most details from preparing the sample to identification of sugar solution used as part of the experiment.
